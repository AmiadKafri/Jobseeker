# Copilot Instructions

This project is a web application that allows users to track all job search notes and process efficiently.
The application is built using React using typescript for the frontend and Node.js using typescript as well for the backend and it uses MongoDB as the database.

## Coding Standards

- Use camelCase for variable and function names.
- Use PascalCase for component names.
- Use single quotes for strings.
- Use 2 spaces for indentation.
- Use arrow functions for callbacks.
- Use async/await for asynchronous code.
- Use const for constants and let for variables that will be reassigned.
- Use destructuring for objects and arrays.
- Use template literals for strings that contain variables.
- Use the latest JavaScript features (ES6+) where possible.
- Always use TypeScript with strict typing.
- Use React functional components and hooks. Avoid class components.
- Separate logic, UI, and state.
- Use absolute imports with module aliasing (e.g., @components, @lib, @hooks).
- Use zod or yup for runtime schema validation.
- Ensure accessibility (a11y) and semantic HTML.
- Use responsive, mobile-first design with utility-first CSS (Tailwind CSS preferred).
- Optimize performance (lazy load, suspense, memoization, bundling).
- For backend, use clean architecture with clear layering (routes, controllers, services, utils).
- Follow REST or GraphQL best practices with proper error handling.
- Use environment variables and never hard-code secrets or config values.
- Write modular, testable code. Use Jest/Testing Library for unit/integration tests.
- Maintain clean Git history with meaningful commit messages (Conventional Commits preferred).
- Document all components, hooks, and API endpoints (JSDoc or MDX if needed).
- Design with pixel-perfection and deep UX thinking.
